## Task 1

Add your name to the list below 'Entries'.

- **Fork the repo, create a new branch (called Task1), make changes and send a pull request**
  - [This article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) should give you a good idea of what pull requests are how to use them.

Your entry should maintain alphabetic order and it should be in the format:
   * ` your name [username](http://github.com/username)`.  


- Your Pull Request must have only one commit (if there are multiple commits, you should squash them). 


## Task 5

- Create a new branch (called Task5) in your fork. Add a dummy piece of code and commit it to this branch. Do this 5 more times. 
- Now you want to **remove some intermediate commits**. Remove commit no. 2 and 4 using rebase.
- Push all the commits into Task5 and create a Pull Request.


Some guidelines for the tasks:

* Your Pull Request must be rebased on the latest master.  
* This commit must have a message that is explanatory. For eg. for Task 1: `Add name to README (Name here)`.
* Name of the PR must be informative. For eg. for Task 1: `(Task1) Add my name to the README (Name here)`.
